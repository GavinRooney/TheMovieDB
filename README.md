## Dependancies
This project uses cocoapods. If you do not already have cocoapod set up on your machine run the following to install.

`sudo gem install cocoapods`

Once cloning the repo to your local machine move into the project directory in terminal and run the following

`pod install`

You can now open the workspace in xcode and run it on your simulator
